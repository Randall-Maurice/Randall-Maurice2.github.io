        <p id="mytext">     Hello and welcome to my page, in this page I will be sharing my insights about being an online scholar amidst the pandemic.
		<br><br> The pandemic greatly affected everything at first, changing the norm of all countries. Everything has now moved to doing the usual things online. Even other people became compulsive shoppers or buyers, sometimes causing products to be unavailable from the big spenders that now tend to hoard. Now this were factors that didn't affect me but as well as everyone else.
		<br><br> In my honest opinion, find the current setup tough since there are many factors in life that may affect studies which may be network problems, illnesses, out of town events, breakdowns, unexpected scenarios, added responsibilities, a change in study environment, emergencies, loss of senses due to lack of sleep, important attendings and many much more. Though it is tough, it is manageable if you give proper work and effort in studying although sometimes, I'm not gonna lie, I feel tired from looking at certain homeworks.
		<br><br> This set-up may be difficult for other people but hopefully they'll get used to it. It is in fact interesting because now I, as a scholar of PSHS, get to keep my time in my hands or in both my mom and my hands since some events will actually contradict my schedule and tend to be rescheduled or postponed
		<br>You can check the other responses of my fellow scholars in the Group Icon and what I think are the Pro's and Cons of Online Class
