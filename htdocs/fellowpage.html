            <h2>Fellow E-Scholars' Insights</h2>
        </div>
        <p>     Hello and welcome to the page where my fellow E-Scholars share their opinion and insights in the current Class setup, I have interviewed my my fellow batchmates and they shared answers gladly, there were a variation of feelings and insights from the responses I gave, here were the given;
		<br><br>-Pretty cool, have a love-hate relationship with it since there's so much stuff i can do along but at the same time i miss doing stuff with everyone. for me online classes are neither easier or harder than f2f classes, it has it's ups and downs but i preferred how things were before, it's harder to manage time because there's a lot of distractions but it's more fun since you have freedom to manipulate your schedule.
		<br><br>-I'd say that my life during quarantine has been dull in a way? The people you can socialize with on a daily basis is few unless you know how to not make the convo awkward. Because of that, I'm more self-reliant and reserved which isn't really a bad thing but concerning if I can't adjust quickly when they allow f2f again. Also, speaking honestly, online learning isn't as effective as face to face. I don't retain as much information during VCs compared to the stock knowledge I had from lessons in grade 7. While it is a good thing that I can re-watch VCs/lessons as much as I want to retain information, it is kind of more time consuming compared to what my routine was in f2f
		<br><br>-For me, online learning has opened a lot of opportunities for me as a student, though it did close plenty at the beginning. The flexibility and fluidity of the schedule helps me spend leisure time whilst submitting my requirements with quality and punctuality expected of a scholar like myself.
		<br><br>-Right now life in quarantine has been interesting. I have experienced many new things that I would have never done before. I have found new interests that I would have not had if not for the quarantine. My school life in quarantine has been a new experience, it was hard at first but now I am getting quite used to it. Being an E-scholar was a very good experience for me, it made me change my lifestyle in ways I did not expect and learning online was a new normal that I needed to get used to but I did not expect it to go for so long.
		<br><br>-I think that it would take a little bit more than 1 and a half year for us to sort out the pandemic since even America a 1st world country is still not yet immune and more variant are soon to be found so I think that it would be longer for us a 3rd world country to be really sure to know when it is safe. This setup made studying less lively compared to how it was before.</p>
