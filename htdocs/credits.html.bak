		<br>Here, you will see the following people who gave their precious time to answer and share several of their opinions on online learning for 1 of my content page. Without them, I would not have another webpage as I do not know what else do I need, maybe it would be a video of some dude doing random stuff because I can't think of any other possible content to make my work meaningful and unique.
		<br>Since you have opened and seen this page, thank you for that. This whole website is made purely of hardwork, considerations, patience and a substantial amount of restless nights trying to make this better than how it used to. A few changes are having github involved, fixed images and all the navigation/redirects, added a social media bar, added a better background and difference between home and content page, and in this updated ver there'll be animated backgrounds and effects on buttons, maybe images, and animation in this webpage.
		<br>As you can see, there are images below. These images are the chosen avatars of people who gave responses in the <a href="htdocs\fellowpage.html">"Fellow E-Scholars' Insights"</a> webpage. Hover on each images and know more about them in a somewhat anonymous way.
