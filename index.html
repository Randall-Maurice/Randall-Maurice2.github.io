        <p id="WelcomeText">     Hello and welcome to my webpage, A Scholar's Life in Quarantine.<br><br> This is a Comsci Project applying our basic knowledge whilst making it informative and tackle a current socioeconomic problem.
        I have picked how quarantine affects my fellow scholars and I, and it contains our different insights, their actual responses and many more relating to those stuff. Just a simple click will, hopefully, present you the proper content you are willing to see.
        <br>
        <br> It may be simple so please bare with me. On the right side, there are choices for you to click and navigate around which are,
        <br> 1 a student, containing my own opinions, ideas and other insights from the current school set-up which is online learning.
        <br> 2 a group of hands risen, emphasizing on the group, this is where you will locate a few of my fellow batchmates explaining their insights and sharing their own opinions, and their responses are varied yet united in some way. 
        <br> 3 a light bulb, which it may represent as "Idea". Here I tried to compile what my fellow scholars and I thought of as Pro's and Con's of online learning and try to compare it back when we were attending Face to Face classes.
        <br><br>
        <br>And on the final note, there may be other stuff here, if I had the Idea and the intelligence or capabilities to add them here, but hopefully this is as satisfactory enough as a normal blog or website, anyway I'd express my great gratitude to you, thank you for giving your time into reading this.

Thank you very much Sir Leo Macalalad, for still accepting my overdue requirement, I know it is very late. Hopefully this is good? Sorry for all the late compliances. Continuing this in the 2nd quarter made it seem a little bit surreal and somewhat easy compared to how I first encountered CSS. Thank you one again and sorry for the late compliances. I just had troubles in the file images and I don't know why it won't load at first but i think it is fixed." src="images/SendMeToBinXD.png" style="width:600px; height:215px;"></p>
